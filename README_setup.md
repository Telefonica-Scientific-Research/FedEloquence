# Installation, Setup and Running of FedEloquence for LLMs Fine-tuning

First, use a virtual environment manager such as uv to create a virtual environment. Make sure you are using Python 3.9.0.
To install uv please follow the next guidelines: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation or just run the following command:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```bash
uv venv FedEloq --python 3.9.0
source FedEloq/bin/activate
```

Clone the specific branch of the FederatedScope repository to your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Telefonica-Scientific-Research/FedEloquence.git
```

Open the FedEloquence directory and build the package to obtain a distribution file:
```bash
cd FedEloquence
uv build
```

With the package built, you can now install it locally to test it out. Use the following command:
```bash
uv pip install dist/federatedscope-0.3.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

If you're developing the package and want to make sure changes are immediately reflected without rebuilding every time, you can also install in editable mode: 

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

Before using DeepSpeed, review the configuration file `ds_config` and ensure it contains the appropriate training parameters for your hardware, such as gradient_accumulation_steps, train_micro_batch_size_per_gpu, and train_batch_size.

Check if fine-tuning an LLM in standalone mode works correctly with DeepSpeed. Run the following script to verify that the fine-tuning process is functioning properly:

```bash
deepspeed federatedscope/main.py --cfg configs/standalone/occiglot-7B-eu5-instruct/ds_3c_200r_30ls.yaml
```

To ensure that the correct CUDA paths are set, add the following lines to your `.bashrc` (or equivalent shell configuration file). The CUDA version should be around version 12 (e.g., 12.4, 12.5, or 12.6). If you donâ€™t already have the [CUTLASS](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass) repository installed, clone and set it up on your machine.

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12/bin/:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12/lib64:/usr/local/cuda-12/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-12
export CUTLASS_PATH=/home/user/repos/cutlass 
```

After editing `.bashrc`, don't forget to run:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
